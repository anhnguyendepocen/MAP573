["ref.html", "Chapter 13 References", " Chapter 13 References This lecture was prepared using many ressources. Credit may be given to the R bloggers website https://www.r-bloggers.com, the book R for Statistics (Cornillon et al. 2012) and the excellent MOOC on coursera from Johns Hopkins University with Roger D. Peng, Brian Caiffo and Jeff Leek. Their youtube channel is excellent as well. Many references are available. We should mention Revolutionâ€™s blog (\\#fig:nice-fig)Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \\@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \\@ref(tab:nice-tab). ```r knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', booktabs = TRUE ) ``` Table: (\\#tab:nice-tab)Here is a nice table!
